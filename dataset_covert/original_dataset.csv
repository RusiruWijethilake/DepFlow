to say that I'm very happy is a severe understatement,1
every single person I talked to at that place was so nice and understanding and perfect,1

I ask her what her fav outfit was and she says she doesn't know the name of the girl but she can draw it,1
"then I ask how she knew about cosplay and she says ""I really like anime girl outfits and I used to cosplay myself""",1
she says 2 weeks AND THAT SHE'LL DO IT FOR FREE,1
so we talk out all the details and she says she'll even make me her thighhigh boots and glasses and then I ask how long it'll take her,1
then she pulls up a paper and starts drawing her outfit and asking me all these questions about it http://t.co/MKzm0xkysb,1
at that point I started freaking out like she actually knows homura and all the megukas,1
"now I ask if she'd make me a cosplay of homura and she says ""is that the emo girl from the madoka anime?""",1
turns out my mom is a total weeb,1
she took out her iPad and showed me a collection of manga and anime and Love Live of all things,1
"I asked if she knew what cosplaying was and she said yes, then I asked if she was familiar with anime and she got really offended",1
already was pretty happy about that but I decided to test her promise and her sewing skills,1
at the end of the talk she says she fully accepts who I am and will support me in any way possible and a year before she kicked me out,1
its late night and she starts asking me about a bunch of trans stuff and I just answer her honestly,1
the reason I was supposed to go see my mom was she wanted to talk to me about something face to face,1
I was already in awe over that but the day got even better,1
I asked him about it and he said hes really into 90s anime and jp culture,1

We ended up making about $300 in thirty minutes and that was pretty cool.,1

@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l it could go both ways. Babies don't know how to people yet.,1
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l she took it to the place where it needed to go. GENIUS.,1
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l holy shit you're right,1
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l anyway have we fully defined twat nugget yet?,1
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l not to mention an entire wall of pens.,1
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l we have a wide selection of chocolate and energy bars.,1
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l dude it is. Our candy section is ridiculously massive and it takes all day.,1
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l I should be shelving books not act as a living vending machine.,1
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l restocking candy is mine. I work in a med school bookstore.,1
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l oh you poor girl. I'm actually pretty lucky as far as retail jobs go tbh.,1
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l sales and clearance racks are my own personal brand of hell.,1
"@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l I work retail, I'm well aware there is no escape.",1
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l those who put their money on the counter and leave...,1
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l I always stayed home where ya safe from the twat nuggets,1
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l thank god I work for the state and my store never has to do Black Friday.,1
@liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l @GenevieveVerso you started this oh great leader,1
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l aka what should be common sense but isn't.,1
"@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l nah, since it's a philosophy by a religion. We don't worship the twat nugget",1
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l a good number of my customers are twat nuggets.,1
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l I might adhere to the twat nugget philosophy. It sounds very wise.,1
It's so rare that all four of us are here upstairs. Tali has so many people to smell during the movie.,1
"@GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l Plato, Betham, Mills. Got it.",1
Finally convinced dad that we only needed to watch the original trilogy. Success.,1
@GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l I've never actually studied it. I probably will eventually. Sounds like my kinda thing.,1
Nick Valentine better get max approval after this damn quest. I DESERVE IT,1
Running backwards and shooting aimlessly is a strategy I use waaaay too often.,1
@GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l I may not know anything about the subject but damn I'll try to contribute.,1
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos do I really want to answer that?,1
@MissLusyd @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso only way accepted.,1
"@MissLusyd @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso sometimes you gotta go deep, man.",1
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos Welp. I'm powerless.,1
@GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd which I don't. They tried that a few years back didn't stick.,1
@MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso ahhhh if only it were that simple.,1
@TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso actually completely impossible to be honest.,1
@MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso eh. It honestly is what we make of it. My beliefs are kinda hard to summarize.,1
@MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso Same actually. Twitter is not made for theological discussions,1
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos wait I do. So God's will is chair fights?,1
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos ...I legit do not know how to respond to that.,1
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos so classy because divine beings can do whatever they want? Pshh,1
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos cmon now surely it'd be classier than that. Surely.,1
@MissLusyd @TheFuxedos I know. I work in retail. I KNOW.,1
@GenevieveVerso if I were truly bright I wouldn't have gotten so lost in this stupid game just now.,1
@TheFuxedos another one? I thought that event was last thanksgiving.,1
@GenevieveVerso oh pshh. Not really.,1
@GenevieveVerso yeah once I get one of those fancy Masters degrees I can move out. Only just got an associates so it'll be awhile.,1
@GenevieveVerso I say I'm independent while living rent free at my parents house so eh?,1
@GenevieveVerso what can I say I'm an independent woman?,1
@GenevieveVerso eh. I'll just try to get one of those degree things and see if I can get one of those job things,1
@GenevieveVerso yeah. I'm fresh out of those.,1
@GenevieveVerso I dot actually get too much attention. Mostly because I don't go anywhere.,1
@GenevieveVerso yeah the big blue doe eyes don't exactly help with scariness.,1
@GenevieveVerso yeah. We seem to be in the same boat. I'm actually 5'2 and look barely legal so if you actually have an arsenal can we share,1
@GenevieveVerso scary guy friends are a must while out in public,1
@GenevieveVerso aaaaand this is why I don't interact with people outside the Internet.,1
@MissLusyd not too much a pie person. Or a tea person. I have very plain tastes.,1
@MissLusyd is it sweet and delicious?,1
@MissLusyd I don't drink but that looks amazing.,1
@GenevieveVerso daw thanks. ~&lt;3,1
@GenevieveVerso personally I think I look like I'm 12 but y'know.,1
@GenevieveVerso eh. Like I said I'm mostly doing this for my health.,1
@GenevieveVerso I'm not. I'm jus really really short and 170 may not be a lot to some people but I SHOULD be 125,1
@GenevieveVerso dude I'm not one of them. I've never broken a bone in my life.,1
@GenevieveVerso actually there's a legit reason: I broke my toe last year by standing on it. My bones can't handle being this heavy.,1
@GenevieveVerso but I COULD have a perfect ass and be even cuter.,1
@GenevieveVerso it's the booty. I need to get rid of it. https://t.co/8mEQ2ePgKk,1
"@GenevieveVerso that's sweet but I am on the chubby side and my body needs to be thinner to be healthy. Delicate bones, y'see.",1
@ProfessorOtaku too pure...too precious for this world.,1
@ProfessorOtaku ...look I am well aware that I am tiny and chubby but I can have dreams.,1
@ProfessorOtaku DO YOU NOT BELIEVE ME,1
One of these days I will do enough sit ups to have abs of steel. *sigh* why is exercising so haaaaaaard,1
No snuggles until princess Tali has filled her quota of kitty fetch. No sleeping either unless you want your face licked,1
Princess Tali DEMANDS to play kitty fetch. Or else she will make sad crying noises.,1
@PikaHikariKT they're all in my bed somewhere.,1
Tali keeps stealing my hair ties for kitty fetch to the point where I have none because she has lost most of them.,1
No it doesn't matter what you're doing or what time it is. You will play Kitty fetch when Kitty wants to play Kitty fetch.,1
@Tauri3l @MissLusyd @azarkansero blech,1
@MissLusyd not to mention most likely fatal. HEYO.,1
@MissLusyd oh god. I dunno. Can we really top car fucking?,1
@MissLusyd good! Now we can move on to something more fun!,1
@MissLusyd just remember not everyone sucks. I know it's hard. Especially since I've cut myself off from actual people,1
@MissLusyd I don't *actually* follow my own advice though.,1
@MissLusyd am I sounding preachy? I just like helping people.,1
@MissLusyd you should carry yourself in a way as such. Like you shouldn't change anything except how you think about yourself.,1
"@MissLusyd well the way I see it, if you *think* everyone thinks that, there's a possibility they do. Fuck them. You ARE a person and-",1
@MissLusyd it could be. Personally I think it looks awesome but different is treated differently by the public,1
@MissLusyd I hate people sometimes.,1
@Tauri3l @MissLusyd tear him to pieces. Then screenshot it and show us.,1
"@MissLusyd seriously? If you don't mind me asking, why?",1
@MissLusyd we all have our coping mechanisms. And I think no human being should treat another like shit but eh? life happens.,1
@MissLusyd I bet. Destroying men's concept of existence sounds so badass tbh.,1
"@MissLusyd ahh yes. I wasn't too good at messing with them, my trolling techniques are too uncreative. I'm sure you're a master at it.",1
@MissLusyd yeah after the 50thish one I was bored. It's like the same guy was messaging me from different accounts,1
"@MissLusyd I always got the ""lonely gamer"" types.",1
@MissLusyd mine was too at first but it stopped being funny after a few months so I stopped.,1
@MissLusyd see that's why I left those sites years ago. I am a weird creepy guy magnet as well.,1
@MissLusyd oh god. That's terrifying.,1
@LonerDreamer eh that and messing with mccready seem to be doing it for her,1
@LonerDreamer well she just got done with finals. I think she's exercising pent up rage. It's hard being an engineering major apparently,1
"@LonerDreamer she also ditches him frequently and ""accidentally"" shoots him. Yet she won't change companions for some reason",1
@LonerDreamer also everytime he complains about her hoarding she changes his outfit and gives him all her junk.,1
@LonerDreamer yeah I vaguely remember him in fallout 3. It's been a few years but it's really recent for her. The memories are still fresh,1
@LonerDreamer @PikaHikariKT I shudder at the thought of if she finds one even more ridiculous looking.,1
@tskimoongoddess I'm too nice to do that. Such a shame.,1
@tskimoongoddess she's just incredibly tacky with looting and extorting caps. Also underleveled like 70% of the time.,1
"@PikaHikariKT also she does a lot of other stuff to him too. Push him off lifts, dress him in bright clothes, etc.",1
"@PikaHikariKT I should've taken a picture of the hat of shame, then.",1
I have no idea why she takes delight in torturing that poor man but it's amazing,1
"Also there's the fact that she makes MacCready wear the ""hat of shame"" for ""being a turd in Fallout 3""",1
Y'know the really dumb decisions that you try not to make in games? She makes all of them because why not,1
I think watching my sister play fallout 4 might be just as fun as playing it if not more.,1
Sleepy kitty. https://t.co/vcT9xphXiN,1
@LonerDreamer wellllll actually you can't change his clothes until his exile apparently. danse',1
@LonerDreamer I will definitely take pictures.,1
my sister says she's gonna dress everyone like that.  https://t.co/tlv5GfV9nY,1
there are tears. his legs look lovely. https://t.co/cjmBtCRb9P,1
@GenevieveVerso @Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos wow. Such class.,1
@GenevieveVerso @Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos what does he think about Hancock's sparkling personality?,1
@GenevieveVerso @Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos that's terrible! Why would he do such a thing?,1
@GenevieveVerso @Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos actually she hasn't gotten there yet.,1
@GenevieveVerso @Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos this is what she's wearing https://t.co/BOaicgBf51,1
@GenevieveVerso @Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos was let off early. I'm watching my sister fail @ fallout,1
WHY DOESNT SHE EVER SNUGGLE WITH ME LIKE THIS https://t.co/csaqCX2dgM,1
@GenevieveVerso @Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos ugh. No.,1
This is Tallahassee. https://t.co/S4eDrDlKRH,1
@BattleMonkeyz sounds like a party,1
@atmora too tired,1
@BattleMonkeyz ugh you have no idea how dead it was.,1
@BattleMonkeyz my boss told me to take a nap for her. I@might actually do that.,1
@BattleMonkeyz actually my boss let me go home.,1
At long last hell has released me.,1
@LacTheWatcher that ain't a diploma. that's a diploma /frame/,1
I am in hellllllllll https://t.co/WwVBBhtIy8,1
@azarkansero @Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos I'm like 60% sure I'm leaving early again. It's noon and no one is here.,1
@Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos we have one guy in the store rn. One guy.,1
@Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos you too? We're having a sale and it's failing miserably,1
@Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos please keep them rolling it's the only thing keeping me awake right now.,1
@MissLusyd @Shardfox @theWitchElf @azarkansero @TheFuxedos ugh I'd join in but I'm multitasking.,1
@MissLusyd @Shardfox @theWitchElf @azarkansero @TheFuxedos ...have I told you that I love you already? Because I do.,1
@MissLusyd @Shardfox @theWitchElf @azarkansero @TheFuxedos how long are we gonna keep the car thing up?,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero @theWitchElf @Shardfox @TheFuxedos we are pretty hot aren't we?,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero @theWitchElf @Shardfox @TheFuxedos I would marry us.,1
I may be falling asleep. https://t.co/3YtZwdHmZw,1
@MissLusyd @Shardfox @theWitchElf @azarkansero @TheFuxedos oooof course you did.,1
@BattleMonkeyz a medical school bookstore run by the state.,1
@BattleMonkeyz a medical school bookstore run by the state.,1
@MissLusyd @Shardfox @theWitchElf @azarkansero @TheFuxedos ...where..HOW did you find that?,1
@BattleMonkeyz eh we had a good sale last week so eh?,1
"""I'm running away and never coming back"" ""Ok. I'm burning down the store, is that okay?"" ""Pshh I get paid regardless, so sure""",1
@Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos that screenshot says it all. Beautiful.,1
@theWitchElf @MissLusyd @Shardfox @azarkansero @TheFuxedos it honestly looks like the car equivalent of a tricycle,1
@theWitchElf @MissLusyd @Shardfox @azarkansero @TheFuxedos look I didn't even know~loving~ cars was possible til last night.,1
@theWitchElf @Shardfox @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos omaigawd that's awesome.,1
"I told my boss it MIGHT be the worst sale ever and she's like ""whaddya mean MIGHT be. If I fall asleep, you can hit me""",1
ohmaigawd this is the worst sale in the history of sales.,1
@theWitchElf @Shardfox @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos i honestly don't know what that is.,1
"@MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos I'm just sorry I missed the really great/terrible ones. Ah, well. I had to sleep.",1
Sooooo...the sale is a complete failure.,1
RT @michaelianblack: People online are so much more cautious about revealing movie spoilers than they are about calling each other racial e…,1
RT @LOLGOP: Trump basically wants to be the president of Russia.,1
RT @UncleYo: This is the first time in history that Star Wars and Christmas have been said together without collective groaning.,1
I feel oodles better. Still not 100% but some recovery is better than no recovery.,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos I wake up to a bunch of car puns. You guys are great.,1
Back to bed. Night folks.,1
@MissLusyd sorry. I'm on a diet and my mother is being my enforcer. *sigh*,1
@MissLusyd oh yeah. That too.,1
Awwww my kitty wants in. Guess my parents don't give enough belly rubs.,1
"@MissLusyd my mother would take one look at that and be like ""that's too many calories why are you drinking that?""",1
"@MissLusyd """"""""""""""""""""""healthy""""""""""""""""""""",1
@MissLusyd @Tory_B_Martin @azarkansero seriously I'll probably be back in an hour. My insomnia is predictable,1
@MissLusyd @Tory_B_Martin @azarkansero and with that. I should go to bed. I'll probably be awake in a couple of hours. It happens.,1
@MissLusyd @Tory_B_Martin @azarkansero @TheFuxedos I should be sorry. I'm not. This was a great way to spend a Thursday night.,1
@Tory_B_Martin @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos that was the plan actually,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero yup. Guess I'm staying up.,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero actually not the weirdest thing I've heard of after the car conversation,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero I should go to bed but I probably won't.,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero weird-er I suppose,1
@azarkansero @MissLusyd THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I WANT TO BE KNOWN FOR,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero I got one too https://t.co/NSrvYtLtno,1
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos fine. I'd fuck a Lexus.,1
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos I am a CHILLLD,1
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos I am TOO PURE to disclose this information,1
"@MissLusyd @azarkansero or...""Sinnin' wagon""? :D",1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos this might be the strangest conversation of my 24 1/2 years of life,1
"@MissLusyd @azarkansero ""Danny if you could fuck a car, what would you fuck?""",1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero ...actually The pure thing is mostly an act. Mostly.,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero TOOO PURE I AM.,1
@azarkansero @MissLusyd that is a door we should leave locked.,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero NO. I AM TOO PURE TO SEE IT,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero I'm surprised there isn't actual footage of this. Guys really do love their cars. No. I don't want to actually see,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero what if the Volkswagen doesn't get his motor running?,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero well I assume he's dead.,1
@azarkansero @MissLusyd oh god what is wrong with us the tears are back,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero yeah but I mean fatally exploding.,1
@azarkansero @MissLusyd yup. I can see it.,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero MAYBE HE LIKES THE DANGER OF STICKING HIS DICK IN SOMETHING THAT MIGHT EXPLODE,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero unless the condom is also metal with some sort of insulation coating,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero oh god I'm crying,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero wouldn't that like...I dunno..burn a dick off?,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero wait. Is the car on during the banging?,1
@azarkansero @MissLusyd I started at exhaust and then my brain died.,1
"@MissLusyd @azarkansero I dunno if we can top ""burnin' rubber""",1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero you are REALLY good at this,1
@azarkansero @MissLusyd for my own personal amusement you should do this,1
@azarkansero @MissLusyd oh my god. Block that boy asap,1
@azarkansero @MissLusyd wait. What. This is why I don't do facebook,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero I can't taste food atm so everything is meh,1
@MissLusyd @azarkansero nah it's a whole conversion process. I assume. I dunno.,1
@azarkansero @MissLusyd nope. That is a public service. The opposite of sin.,1
@azarkansero @MissLusyd yes. I am a sinnamon roll without the sin.,1
@azarkansero @MissLusyd I'm too pure and innocent to generate sin so idk,1
@azarkansero WHY CANT YOU TUNE TO C LIKE A NORMAL PERSON,1
@azarkansero @MissLusyd I AM SO BORED GUYS,1
@azarkansero like the whole b flat thing? A transposing nightmare.,1
"@azarkansero yeaaaaaah I am the worst brass player in the history of brass players. Thing is, you guys are tuned differently and it THROWSME",1
@azarkansero string instruments are a series of half and whole steps. If you know the string names you're halfway there.,1
@azarkansero otherwise it seems braggy,1
"@azarkansero thing is, it's very misleading. I feel the need to explain that if you know one string instrument you know most of them.",1
@azarkansero I can't stress enough how mediocre I am music wise.,1
@azarkansero like I said. Not really impressive.,1
@azarkansero I was a music Ed major like four years ago. That's why. Also I have a mezzo soprano vocal range.,1
"@azarkansero a mandolin is a violin with frets. I also play guitar, piano, and I've been instructed in trumpet and baritone",1
"@azarkansero Violin, viola, cello, and bass. All part of the same family",1
@azarkansero it's a lot less impressive than it sounds. Seriously.,1
@azarkansero I used to doodle but I got in trouble for it.,1
"@azarkansero can't write, never trained properly to draw. I'm a mediocre musician who can barely play 9 instruments. Can't contribute much.",1
@MissLusyd ah. I dislike the taste of alcohol so I never drink.,1
@azarkansero eh. She kinda blended in the background to me.,1
@azarkansero I found a one shot that explored it and I wanted it to be longer. It's a shame I can't write.,1
"@MissLusyd don't get too hammered, mmkay?",1
"@azarkansero ah, Tumblr. Well, I dot see too much about piper but I see a LOT of Hancock",1
@azarkansero also it's possible the SS met Prewar Nick since she was a lawyer,1
@azarkansero I reallyreally wanted to romance Nick though. It fits. He's out of time...she's out of time.,1
@azarkansero Tbh I WAS gonna romance Macready but Hancock won me over,1
@azarkansero ughhhh I was so mad,1
@azarkansero *boring,1
@azarkansero Hancock is second and I'll use Deacon and Piper a lot. Macready complains too much and the others are prong,1
@azarkansero Nick. Nick is the best. Hands down. I'm only romancing Hancock because Nick is unavailable.,1
@BattleMonkeyz yeah there's only three of us and 2 registers.,1
@azarkansero she's so funny.,1
"@azarkansero I'm actually a pretty silent player. I'll yell at companions and talk to the screen but my sister should stream, tbh.",1
@BattleMonkeyz yes less shit is good. Hopefully I'm not running the sale solo like last week.,1
@azarkansero it was less badass because a) she's wearing the outfit with yellow shorts and b) she screams a lot,1
@MissLusyd ...having fun? :D,1
"@BattleMonkeyz had to go home early because I felt like shit. I rested, still feel like shit but less shit.",1
@BattleMonkeyz trying to get healthy before the big sale tomorrow.,1
@Arcadyagami I CANT STOP PLAYING. There's so much todo.,1
"@azarkansero she's level 5, has no ammo and armed with a machete.",1
@azarkansero I'm jealous. I was watching my sister play for awhile which was probably the funniest thing I've seen in awhile.,1
"So since I have been cut off from Fallout 4, I have nothing to do. What's up guys?",1
"I don't think I can sit through Hayden Christensen's acting ever again. I'm sorry, father.",1
"But my dad INSISTS we watch the prequels because ""we must prepare"".",1
Of course I'll join once they start the original.,1
"So my sister is home and my dad has roped her into watching all six Star Wars movies. In ""chronological"" order. Hahahahahaha",1
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @Tory_B_Martin @TheFuxedos aw damn. I always miss the fun stuff.,1
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @Tory_B_Martin @TheFuxedos what'd I miss?,1
Who's a pretty girl? You are! You are! https://t.co/tx91Wqup8X,1
@MissLusyd @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @tskimoongoddess @azarkansero I'm surprised it was still in one piece after that.,1
@MissLusyd @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @tskimoongoddess @azarkansero I dunno I'm not too big on thrift store chic,1
@MissLusyd @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @tskimoongoddess @azarkansero oh god I bet it felt good to get rid of that asshole.,1
@MissLusyd @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @tskimoongoddess @azarkansero sweeeeeet,1
@MissLusyd @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @tskimoongoddess @azarkansero oh god we can do that?,1
@Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @tskimoongoddess @azarkansero pshh I just picked a ton of locks. Got his full approval a few days ago.,1
"@Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @tskimoongoddess @azarkansero I've actually never used it, I just collected it for extra caps.",1
@TheFuxedos @Tauri3l @MissLusyd @tskimoongoddess @azarkansero *find,1
@TheFuxedos @Tauri3l @MissLusyd @tskimoongoddess @azarkansero I'm fresh out. Glue is hard to god dammit.,1

"@azarkansero YOU SCARED ME FOR NOTHING I WENT BACK TO SANCTUARY AND HE WAS FINE. I took the chems from him, yknow. Just in case.",1
Poor woman. It's her first day.,1

@NoahClue we're having a sale tomorrow so I need to be on top shape,1
@NoahClue less things to make me feel worse. I already feel pretty awful,1
"@azarkansero in my mind, no pet is as cool as Tali",1
I was pathetic enough to be sent home. Now I have til 8am tomorrow to actually get better.,1
@azarkansero aw! How pretty!,1
@azarkansero be warned: I'm obsessed with her.,1
@azarkansero yes she does.,1

"@MissLusyd yes you do seem knowledgeable in the subject. I don't usually, my main problem is seasonal allergies which Claritin fixes.",1
@MissLusyd I'm pretty sure it's dry sinus. I'm not sniffly at all.,1
"@MissLusyd Pshh. I work next to a hospital, I'm bound to get sick occasionally.",1
@MissLusyd dude as long as I don't have to drink it it's cool.,1
@MissLusyd I'll try it if I end up staying over lunch. It's pretty miserable.,1
@MissLusyd we do have those. Might do that if boss lady won't let me go home.,1
@MissLusyd haha well ironically I'm stuck at a medical school bookstore and we have none of that in our drug section.,1
@MissLusyd I have no idea. My throat hurts too. I think it's dry sinus or something since I feel pressure and junk.,1
I asked to go home but I never got a straight answer. Welp. Guess I'm staying here.,1
I'm not even sniffly. the top of my nose feels raw when I breathe through it and it's miserable.,1
My sinuses hate me.,1
My sinuses hate me.,1
It feels like I JUST left this god damn store.,1

@SW1128 I think ASB is the cheapest broker and it's a minimum $30 per trade. Smart shares you pay a percentage of your investment no minimum,0
@SW1128 but the smart money is always on index funds. A Random Walk Down Wall Street is a good book to read,0
@SW1128 low as costs due to the fact they're all index funds. Minimum $500 buy in. Minimum $50 regular contribution,0
@SW1128 and yea smart shares is the shit. If you're wanting to get into individual stock picking though it's not suitable,0
@SW1128 a few rules of thumb are typically all you need,0
@SW1128 asset allocation would all depend on your own goals and I've never personally read anything touching on this topic.,0
